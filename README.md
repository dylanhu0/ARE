# Description du projet
========

Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior among school aged children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Both kids who are bullied and who bully others may have serious, lasting problems.
Bullying can take on many forms which are just as emotionally and psychologically damaging as physical intimidation and harassment. There are three general forms of bullying: Verbal bullying, Physical bullying and cyberbullying.
Generally, people who are bullied have one or more risk factors like mental disorder, different race or ethnicity, different sexual orientation…
According to NSCS(National School Climate Survey) 35.3% of students with behavioral and emotional disorders, 25% of African-American students, 74.1% of LGBT students were all bullied.
Research has found that children and adolescents who have been bullied can experience negative psychological(depression, anxiety), physical(being injured from a physical attack), and academic effects(impact on grades) .
However, inclusion and friendship can have extremely positive effects on kids and teens lives and their mental states. Making friends is a social skill that is important, not for popularity purposes, but purely because friendship can provide many benefits and lower the risk of getting bullied.
Our project demonstrates, hypothetically, the effect of the victim when bullied. With Tkinter, we were able to create a small environnement representing the scene. Each person is represented with a small circle: The victim with a popping circle, the bullies with a red circle, the friends with a green circle and people who don’t take actions are represented with a white circle.
Before lunching the program, you are invited to choose between one of the three causes of bullies(button ‘Les causes d’agression’), one of the three  types of bullies(button ‘Les types d’agressions) and the number of friends you want to have in the simulation(the scale ‘Nombre d’amis’) then you press the button ‘Go’. With time you will be able to see how the parameters you chose will influence the victim. For exemple if you chose the third cause, the third type, with 0 friend ( It’s the worse scenario!) you will be able to see the victim changing to the color black in the end of the simulation which means depression. After you clear everything(button ‘effacer’) you can repeat the simulation with different parameters to see how the victim will react (color black stands for depression, color dark blue for a bad mood, color blue for a safe victim). In general, having a lot of friends, regardless to the cause or type, can make it hard for the victim to be in a depression.
