# Introduction
Bullying is unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Both people who are bullied and who bully others may have serious, lasting problems.
There are three general forms of bullying: Verbal bullying, Physical bullying and cyberbullying.
Generally, people who are bullied have one or more risk factors like mental disorder, different race or ethnicity, different sexual orientation…
According to NSCS(National School Climate Survey) 35.3% of students with behavioral and emotional disorders, 25% of African-American students, 74.1% of LGBT students were all bullied.
Research has found that children and adolescents who have been bullied can experience negative psychological(depression, anxiety), physical(being injured from a physical attack), and academic effects(impact on grades) .
However, inclusion and friendship can have extremely positive effects on kids and teens lives and their mental states. Making friends is a social skill that is important, not for popularity purposes, but purely because friendship can provide many benefits and lower the risk of getting bullied.
